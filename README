Revised Simplex implementation


NOTES
=====
 * We implemented Blands anti-cycling rule since it is easy to implement. Implementing the lexicographic anti-cycling rule might be more efficient.
 * There might be problems, if the upper bound of a variable is negative... Then one should substitute y = -x.
